# Case Study Creation Error - Fixed

## Problem

When creating a case study, the API was returning a validation error:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "validation_error",
        "message": "Validation failed",
        "details": [
            {
                "expected": "string",
                "code": "invalid_type",
                "path": ["solution"],
                "message": "Invalid input: expected string, received undefined"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Root Cause

The frontend form was sending a field called `content` instead of `solution`, but the API validation schema requires a field called `solution`.

**API Schema (required fields):**
- `title` ✅
- `slug` ✅
- `clientName` ✅
- `industry` ✅
- `challenge` ✅
- `solution` ⚠️ (was missing - form was sending `content` instead)

## Solution

### Files Modified

1. **`src/app/admin/case-studies/new/page.tsx`** (Create form)
   - Changed state variable from `content` to `solution`
   - Changed setter from `setContent` to `setSolution`
   - Updated form field ID from `content` to `solution`
   - Updated form submission to always include required fields
   - Added `required` attribute to `clientName`, `industry`, and `challenge` fields
   - Added red asterisk (*) to required field labels

2. **`src/app/admin/case-studies/[slug]/edit/page.tsx`** (Edit form)
   - Changed state variable from `content` to `solution`
   - Changed setter from `setContent` to `setSolution`
   - Updated form field ID from `content` to `solution`
   - Updated data loading to use `solution` field
   - Updated form submission to send `solution` field

## Changes Made

### Before:
```typescript
const [content, setContent] = useState('');

// In form submission
const data: any = { title, slug, content };
if (clientName) data.clientName = clientName;
if (industry) data.industry = industry;
if (challenge) data.challenge = challenge;
```

### After:
```typescript
const [solution, setSolution] = useState('');

// In form submission
const data: any = { 
  title, 
  slug, 
  solution,
  clientName,
  industry,
  challenge
};
```

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Navigate to `/admin/case-studies/new`
2. Fill out all required fields:
   - Title
   - Slug
   - Client Name (now required)
   - Industry (now required)
   - Challenge (now required)
   - Solution (now correctly named)
3. Submit the form
4. The case study should be created successfully without validation errors

## API Validation Schema Reference

```typescript
const caseStudyCreateSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1, 'Title is required').max(200, 'Title too long'),
  slug: z.string().min(1, 'Slug is required').max(100, 'Slug too long'),
  clientName: z.string().min(1, 'Client name is required'),
  industry: z.string().min(1, 'Industry is required'),
  challenge: z.string().min(1, 'Challenge is required'),
  solution: z.string().min(1, 'Solution is required'),
  results: z.array(z.object({
    metric: z.string(),
    value: z.string()
  })).default([]),
  techStack: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
  heroImage: z.union([
    z.object({
      url: z.string(),
      alt: z.string().optional()
    }),
    z.string()
  ]),
  published: z.boolean().default(true)
});
```
